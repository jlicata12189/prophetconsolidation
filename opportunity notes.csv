I am writing to introduce myself and to start a conversation about HealthEx medical courier services and any current or upcoming needs you may have.  HealthEx is a medical courier service with 10 dispatch centers across the United States and capabilities to service your needs from any major market. We have been in business for 15 years and operate with both live and web-based dispatch 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Our company is dedicated exclusively to Health Care. We have drivers equipped with uniforms, photo identification, coolers, freezers (or dry ice), and scanners. We will learn and adhere to your specific protocols and instructions so that we are able to service your clients as though we were your own employees. Our software has the capabilities to interface with multiple pharmacy systems to give you seamless integration and complete chain of custody tracking from toting to delivery.   We are accredited by both The Joint Commission and ACHC. We are also educated in critical areas such as HIPAA and the handling of Medication.  I know that there are many choices when it comes to couriers, but there are two main things that set HealthEx apart:  Experience - HealthEx has been dedicated to medical courier service since we began doing business in 1999 and our capabilities, technology and ability to react and perform has sustained our success and growth.  Commitment - Our personal commitment is what sets us apart. We have developed and enhanced our processes proven to provide a service superior to our competitors. We are large enough to offer the driver coverage necessary for exceptional service; however we still operate within the mentality, care and code of ethics that allowed us to perform our first delivery in 1999.  We are a private corporation that will give you and your management real answers in real time with real accountability.  Please feel free to call or email us with any questions, comments or to schedule an introductory meeting.

I am writing to introduce myself in hopes that my company might be of service to you.  We feel that our company is a perfect fit for the high demands that you have for your couriers. My request is that we would be able to take whatever steps are necessary to gain your approval as a vendor in the event that you wish to replace one of your couriers in the future.  HealthEx is a medical courier service with locations in Mokena, IL, Des Plaines, Il, Decatur, Il, Peoria, Il, Davenport IA, Roslyn Heights, NY, South Plainfield, NJ, and Albany, NY. We have been in business for 15 years. We operate with live, in-house dispatch, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We are able to provide you with both STAT and routed drivers as dictated by your service needs.     Our company is devoted exclusively to healthcare. We have drivers equipped with uniforms, photo identification, coolers, freezers (or dry ice), and scanners. We will learn and adhere to your specific protocols and instructions, so that we are able to service your clients as though we were your own employees.  We are accredited by both The Joint Commission and ACHC.   I know that there are many choices when it comes to couriers, but there are two main things that set HealthEx apart:  First, HealthEx has been dedicated to medical service since we began doing business 15 years ago. I realize that this has become a popular field in recent years because of its strength in a tough economy, but we have a true thirteen years of experience.   Second, Although we do have the technology that gives you real-time tracking, and we do have over 350 drivers operating daily, and we are educated in critical areas such as HIPAA and the handling of medical equipment, our personal commitment is what sets us apart. HealthEx is in a unique position to service you better than any of our competitors. We are large enough to give you the driver coverage that you will need for proper service, yet we are still a private corporation that will give all of your management real answers in real time with real accountability.   Please feel free to call or email us with any questions or comments. You may also view our website for more information: www.HealthExCourier.com. We would be very happy to meet with you to discuss this opportunity further if you so desire.   Thank you for your consideration of our company and we look forward to hearing from you in the near future.   "

I spoke to Alecia Williams in your Oak Brook, Il facility and was given your name as the Transportation Manager. Here is a brief description of our company.  HealthEx is a medical courier service with offices in Chicago, IL, Roslyn Heights, NY, Albany, NY, South Plainfield, NJ, and Ft. Lauderdale, FL. We have been in business for 14 years. We operate with live, in-house dispatch, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.   Our company is devoted exclusively to healthcare. We have drivers equipped with uniforms, photo identification, coolers, freezers (or dry ice), and scanners. We will learn and adhere to your specific protocols and instructions, so that we are able to service your clients as though we were your own employees. Our software is able to be interfaced with multiple pharmacy systems to give you seamless integration and complete chain of custody tracking from toting to delivery.   We are accredited by both The Joint Commission and ACHC.   I know that there are many choices when it comes to couriers, but there are two main things that set HealthEx apart:  First, HealthEx has been dedicated to medical service since we began doing business 14 years ago. I realize that this has become a popular field in recent years because of its strength in a tough economy, but we have a true fourteen years of healthcare experience.   Second, although we do have the technology that gives you real-time tracking, and we are educated in critical areas such as HIPAA and the handling of medication, our personal commitment is what sets us apart. HealthEx is in a unique position to service you better than any of our competitors. We are large enough to give you the driver coverage that you will need for proper service, yet we are still a private corporation that will give all of your management real answers in real time with real accountability.   Please feel free to call or email us with any questions or comments. You may also view our website for more information: www.HealthExCourier.com. We would be very happy to meet with you to discuss this opportunity further if you so desire.   Thank you for your consideration   "

I suggested that all deliveries going out at the same time in same areas, i can provide a piggy back/add to STAT rate. He agreed and requested revised pricing.  2) Infamous paperwork issue ! Needs all paperwork back within 48 hours, he has 96 hours to provide completed delivery ticket to be billed. Until this issue is fixed the volume wont quite be there and he will continue to take heat from his higher ups. Which leads to the other courier gaining. Competition returns his back work either same day or next day, obviously because they have a higher volume.  3) Questioned why our "" delivery status updates "" email is not acceptable. Stated that billing insurance will not accept it.  4) All in all service has gotten much better, we just need to improve on paperwork turnaround time. "

Then give me a call to discuss.   I have a meeting scheduled October 31st.    They would like to have all locations serviced by one courier.   Currently,  each location does their own thing.

We have had all hands on deck responding to our customers involved with the CA fires….

WE had 250 stats on Saturday from the CA Pharmacy and continue to struggle.    With that said, here is our WA and CA route lists to get you started.

He said that the ND is still on the table. I plyed dumb on the pricing i gave him 2 years ago and said if you send me exaxt locations and times i can set you up with pricing. this way you can have it to show to the hospitals to show then an actual cost for delivery. He digs! I asked about his other locations and he said maybe Rockford to Chi woudl make sense to shop out too. He also can be sold on the big picture to outsource if the price is right. More to come... "

 , , , ,".----------- 3/21/2017 10:28:24 AM - Modified by: SMATLOCK ----------- Activity Hi Stephen,  Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the potential customers we could service out of the Northland Nuclear Medicine location in Bismarck, ND.  Of course not that any of this is not obtainable on line, I would appreciate it if you would keep this information confidential just between us.   I think an important piece of information for figuring it out if it works to service these customers out of Bismarck is what will the cost of deliveries be.  Our business model for these customers would be to use your company or a similar company to make the deliveries and we would simply pass most or all of the cost on to the customers.  The bigger the piece of the pie that the Customers would need to spend on delivery could potentially push them towards staying with getting their own raw materials as they are doing now.  I look forward to seeing what you can do.    Don Kapolnek Director Materials Management and Logistics Hot Shots Nuclear Medicine d.kapolnek@hotshotsnm.com (563) 940-7903     From: Stephen Matlock [mailto:S.Matlock@healthexcourier.com]  Sent: Monday, March 20, 2017 2:38 PM To: d.kapolnek@hotshotsnm.com Subject: HealthEx Courier  Hello Don,   "

The plan is that we would have about 50-75 daily messenger round-trips going from individual optical retail stores in Manhattan to our facility in Long Island City and then back to the optical retail store in Manhattan.  Each package would be 1-2 lbs.  I would like to get some pricing from you based on the volume indicated.  I would be happy to speak with you about it in more details.  Let me know when it is convenient for you and we will coordinate a call.    Thanks, Howard S. Fried, O.D. Direct dial - 718-369-5069  "
